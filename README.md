# Hand-Gesture-recognition
Gestures are a form of nonverbal communication in which visible bodily actions are used to communicate important messages, either in place of speech or together and in parallel with spoken words. Gestures include movement of the hands, face, or other parts of the body.
This code, written in python, recognises gstures of fingers by counting them 1,2,3,4,5 and no hand. It was developed as a part of a blind assistive device.
